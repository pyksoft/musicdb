# MusicDB

This project was created as an assignment project during the Codaisseur two month immersive development training.
The project combines a Music Database for storing artists and songs with chat functionalities. The program is desigined for people who want to keep an online overview of their music collection. With the chatbox people can share music tips and ideas. E.g. one can make a request: does someone know a good Jazz Musician?

## Basic useful feature list:

 * Posting questions and replying to others in one of the chatboxes
 * Finding new artists through the Artist Database
 * Browse artists by Genre
 * Creating a profile for return visits
 * Add Artists to Favorite Artists (will be stored to profile)
 * Gems used: devise, slim-rails, redis, carrierwave, cloudinary, faker, tele-notify, slack-notifier, rails_12factor
